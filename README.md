# Personal Portfolio

## Overview

This is my personal portfolio website, showcasing my work, skills, and experiences. The portfolio is built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, and it is designed to be fully responsive, supporting various devices, including tablets, mobile phones, and desktops. The contact me section utilizes SMTP js as the backend to send email responses directly to me. The user interface of the portfolio is inspired by a design from [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com), specifically by [Drake] but it has been coded entirely from scratch.

## Features

- Responsive Design: The portfolio is optimized for tablets, mobile phones, and desktops to provide a seamless user experience.
